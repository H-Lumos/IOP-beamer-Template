# IOPbeamerTemplate
This template is created to meet the students in IOP, CAS's demand of presentation. 此beamer模板是为了满足中科院物理所学生的汇报需求而创建的。
The .zip file consists of a main .tex file written in LaTex, a .pdf preview file generated based on the former, a .png file of IOP LOGO, several images for testing purpose, a .bib file for testing purpose, and several auxiliary files.  
Many example templates are involved in the preamble, including equation inserting, theme setting, references quotation, contents setting, two columns setting, multi images inserting, list inserting, tabel inseting and so on.
This template is 1st version, and far from perfect cause the author is a beginner in beamer making, any advise is welcome.
